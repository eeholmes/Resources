# Background

## NOAA Fisheries National Modeling Team
Mission: to develop, test, document, and provide national analytical tools that facilitate accuracy, efficiency, and utility of stock assessment methods

## Defining standards for modeling tools

- Documentation
- Testing
- Examples and tutorials
- Standard inputs and outputs
- Reproducible coding standards
- Scientific rigor (published references)


## {data-background=figs/automation_2x.png data-background-size=contain}


## Best investments for researchers

>- Your next user will probably be you, in a few months
>- Reduces errors
>- Makes paper writing/review process less painful
>- Enables easy re-use of functions
>- Makes running on a new dataset simpler
>- Enables easier sharing later

## A personal anecdote
>- Chapter 1: not written well
  >- Errors were found
>- Re-written in python, and `TMB` (soon)

## A personal anecdote
>- Chapter 2: Used functions and error messages and kept code/outputs organized
  >- Rejected twice

# Reproducible architecture

## Overview
- Logically organize project directories
- Explicitly define dependencies
- Use functional programming
- Ruthlessly avoid duplication
- Meaningful consistent naming

## Project directory organization

- Use different directories to separate inputs, outputs, code, and docs
```{}
|-- requirements.txt
|-- data
| |-- raw_foofy_data.csv
|-- doc
| |-- notebook.md
| |-- manuscript.md
| |-- changelog.txt
|-- figs
| |-- foofy_scatterplot.png
|-- src
| |-- make_plots.R
```
- ideally using git

## Relative rather than hardcoded paths to files
![workflow](workflow.PNG)
- From [this](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

##Example from jennybc
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Bad
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy/data")
df <- read.delim("raw_foofy_data.csv")
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("../figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")

#Better
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

df <- read.delim(here("data", "raw_foofy_data.csv"))
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave(here("figs", "foofy_scatterplot.png"))
```  

## Creating R Projects
>- `File -> New Project`
>- Saves the state of your workspace
>- Keeps working directory consistent

## Creating R packages
- Cons:
    - Requires dependencies (Rtools, devtools)
    - Sensitive to directory changes and structure

- Pros:
    - Shortcuts to access/modify package components and git (usethis package)
    - Enforces use of functions & sourcing
    - Easier to convert to a shareable package
  
## Notebooks
>- `File -> New File -> R Notebook`
>- Organize text and code together, without re-knitting
  >- [Example](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/10/05/r-notebooks/)
>- Jupyter: use with `conda` to manage environments and share code easily


## Requirements
>- Requirements for program to work
>- Tests to ensure program has been installed correctly
>- Simplifies returning to and sharing code
>- In `DESCRIPTION` if you are making a package

## Changelog
>- Could be as simple as `changelog.txt` file
>- Easy to add in Notebook
>- Using git simplifies this

## Functions
>- in `src` or `R` directory  
>- No more than 60 lines long
>- Fewer than 6 arguments
>- No globals or `attach()`

## Avoiding duplication
>- Make lists/vectors instead of multiple objects
>- Use iteration (loops) or mapping (`lapply`, `purrr`) wherever possible 
>- Never [copy and paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_and_paste_programming)

## Example from Advanced R
```{r output=FALSE}
# Generate a sample dataset
set.seed(1014)
df <- data.frame(replicate(6, sample(c(1:10, -99), 6, rep = TRUE)))
names(df) <- letters[1:6]
df

#BAD
df$a[df$a == -99] <- NA
df$b[df$b == -99] <- NA
df$c[df$c == -99] <- NA
df$d[df$d == -99] <- NA
df$e[df$e == -99] <- NA
df$f[df$f == -99] <- NA

```

## Better solutions
- Use a function, `lapply`, or `purrr`
```{r eval=FALSE}
fix_missing <- function(x) {
  x[x == -99] <- NA
  x
}

df[] <- lapply(df, fix_missing)

purrr::map_df(df, fix_missing)
```

## Multiple functions
```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1:10, NA)
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x))

lapply(funs, function(f) f(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Meaningful naming and style
>- Be consistent
>- Human and machine readable
>- Don't use names that mean something (`F`,`sum`)
>- Extra credit: [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
>- Help: `lintr` and `styler` packages

# Basic documentation

## Simple comments above every function
- Include above every function a:

    - description
    - detail about each argument
    - detail about the return value
    - examples (extra)

## Documentation example

```{r}
#' Function that loops through and runs scenarios for each of the life histories in the list
#' @param life.histories - list containing life history parameters for each species
#' @param equils - list of equilibrium values for each stock, Fmsy, Bmsy, Bmax
#' @param nyears - number of years to run the simulation for
#' @param nsims - number of simulations
#' @param f.scen - which of the four fishing scenarios to use; 0 =none, 1=low, 2=med, 3=hi.
#' @return out.stats - a list of the scenarios output, each list item is one stock's output
```

# Errors

## Overview 
- Stop
- Debugging
- Unit testing
- Integrated testing

## Error messages
- Use `stop()` to give intelligible feedback
- Check inputs
- Avoid silent failures

```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Check all lifehistory parameters are included
  if(is.null(lh$M)){
    stop("M is missing")
  }
```

## Debugging
>- `debugonce(<functionname>)` allows you to step through code
>- Functional programming supports easier debugging

## Unit testing
- With `testthat()` 
```{r eval = F}
context("String length")
library(stringr)

test_that("str_length is number of characters", {
  expect_equal(str_length("a"), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length("ab"), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length("abc"), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of factor is length of level", {
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("a")), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("ab")), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("abc")), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of missing is missing", {
  expect_equal(str_length(NA), NA_integer_)
  expect_equal(str_length(c(NA, 1)), c(NA, 1))
  expect_equal(str_length("NA"), 2)
})
```


## Integrated testing
>- Equilibrium diagnostics
>- Running with simulated data/fixed inputs
>- Example files you can run to test with

## Automation and feedback
>- Automate tests with TravisCI
>- [Code review on Github](https://github.com/features/code-review/)


## From the Carpentries
- Program defensively, i.e., assume that errors are going to arise, and write code to detect them when they do.
- Write tests before writing code in order to help determine exactly what that code is supposed to do.
Know what code is supposed to do before trying to debug it.
- Make it fail every time.
- Make it fail fast.
- Change one thing at a time, and for a reason.
- Keep track of what you've done.
- Be humble
